Package: lua-resty-tarantool
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, nginx
Description: Library to work with the tarantool NoSQL database
 based on the cosocket driver for the nginx embedded Lua language
 module.
 .
 Because this module is based on the ngx_lua's cosocket API, it inherits
 the advantage of a real nonblocking behaviour running effectively on the
 underlying nginx server ultra-fast technology design, allowing Web
 developers making use of the Lua programming language to script and
 construct extremely high-performance web applications capable to handle
 10K+ connections.
 . 
 Note that this module works for both nginx witth the embedded Lua
 module and the OpenResty bundle.
